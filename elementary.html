          <p>I went to Woodmore Elementary school from grades K-5. Woodmore
            is located in Maryland. This year they have moved buildings
            temporarily as they are completing construction. Many of the teachers
            here shaped how I view learning and taught me to enjoy it. Many of those
            teachers still work at Woodmore, and I often visit them

          <p>One of my best memories at Woodmore was our yearly market day. Students
            would collect coins throughout the year for good behavior and spend them at market day.
            Each class would create different products or services that we could buy. The entire
            school took part and it took up most of the day. I remember creating our own
            wallets for the activity as well.
