          <p>I went to Thomas Johnson Middle School in Prince Georges County.
            The school had a developing STEM curriculum that got me interested
            in engineering. We built many things in our technogolgy class from
            an underwater pvc drone to motor controlled ground vehicles.

          <p>The school had after school STEM clubs that allowed us to further our interests.
            I joined a club that worked to create a prosthetic arm out of reusable materials.
            We spent 1-2 months creating the arm and then competed at county and state levels.
            This started my interest in robotics.
