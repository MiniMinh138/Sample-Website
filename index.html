  <p>Hi! My name is Minh Nguyen. I am currently a student at Cornell University
    studying Computer Science. This is a mock website to provide some information
    about me and to show some of my HTML and CSS skills. Each tab gives some
    information about my life. Feel free to click through the tabs and skim my
    information!
